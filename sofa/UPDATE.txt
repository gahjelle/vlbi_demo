Notes about this SOFA installation
==================================

The version/issue of the SOFA library currently installed can be found
in the 00READ.ME file.

This software is downloaded from the SOFA website
http://www.iausofa.org/current.html

For this demo, only a few of the SOFA routines are needed. The other files have
been deleted. You should download from the SOFA website if you need the full
library.

To compile into Python the f2py-program was used. See more info at
http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/f2py/
